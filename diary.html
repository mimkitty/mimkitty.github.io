                    i should have linked to their web archive pages instead of just
                    downloading and hosting them myself, but i remembered that far too late !!
                    <br /><br />
                    i have been sick the past few days ;-; luckily it isn't covid !! turns out it is probably strep :P but i dont have tonsils so it isn't
                    so bad !! m taking medicine for it rn, hopefully whatever it is goes away !! after i recover i plan on exercising again, but while i rest,
                    i am going to work on my website and browse the internet a lil bit !!
                    <br /><br />
                    i have sososososo many ideas it is overwhelming !! i need to find my center and regroup, and maybe relax a lil. and take things one at a time !!
                    i just get so creative and have little ideas pop in my head all the time, my to-do list grows daily !! i need to learn to write it all down haha !!
                    <br /><br />
                    but i have been working really hard on my website !! i updated the little trademark thing at the bottom . . .  i also have been working on blinkies, buttons, banners, and stamps. it is a whole lot of fun,
                    i need to remember to make time for my hobbies and have fun every once in a while, instead of worrying soso much about my health and such !!

                    lately i have had less time to work on my programming & game design, i have been so busy with other things. this week i have two dentist appointments
                    to attend, one for a consultation to remove my wisdom teeth, and another for a cleaning. i am not excited. i do not mind the dentist, but i fear the surgery that is to
                    come.
                    <br /><br />
                    i have been feeling very well. i have been working hard on my health and fitness, because i realize i must be serious about my health. i have multiple health conditions,
                    my most prominent one being type 2 diabetes, which impacts my body and how it functions greatly. to manage it, and to hopefully put it in remission, i have been altering
                    my diet to something that i can sustain for a long time, but also does not elevate my blood sugars very much.
                    <br /><br />
                    i have been focusing a lot on exercise as well. for a long time, i did not exercise. i had no energy because i struggled with depression much more in the past. since moving
                    and gaining more control over my life, i have far more energy. i now do yoga, cardio, and calisthenics everyday, and soon, i will start jogging every other day. exercise has changed my life
                    and how i feel about myself. my body feels better every day, i feel stronger and more flexible and i am full of energy. i also feel more confident, and it makes me happy.
                    <br /><br />
                    so that is why i have been a bit inactive . . . i am finding a balance in life right now, and most of my time needs to be dedicated to maintaining my mental and physical
                    health. after this week, when less energy is dedicated to worrying about the dentist, i hope that i may start working on things again. it feels as if i have less creativity,
                    perhaps i have less room for it, so i have not had a lot of fully formed ideas. i hope i can find something lovely to show all of you, but until then, i will be working on these
                    necessary things in my life. thank you for your love and patience.

                    i had a very good breakfast. i had seaweed soup with ginseng green tea . . .
                    with a salmon omelette. it made me feel warm and nice. it felt good cooking for myself today, and i wish to learn more recipes. soon i must shop for groceries, to get vegetables. i wish to make miso soup with all of the things i like!
                    <br /><br />

                    last night my partner and i watched howl's moving castle. thus far, it has been one of my favorite ghibli movies. it had excellent art, lore, and pacing, and was emotional. i loved it. the world felt so big and interesting. perhaps i should read the book it was based off of.
                    <br /><br />

                    now, today, i am studying a javascript library that will allow me to embed HTML games, so i can share things with you all. i have been getting a lot better, i understand more things with web development and game development . . . i aim to get even better and release a lot this year . . . but if i don't, there's always more time and more to create.
                    <br /><br />

                    thank you for your love and support. it's something i am grateful for everyday, to have people i can interact with, to have people enjoy the same things as i do, and to have people enjoy my work and feel comforted by it.

                    today i bought some seaweed soup. i have never had it, i think, so i cannot wait to try it. i also purchased miso paste to make better miso soup with, as i
                    usually eat the instant miso. i think that the paste has more live bacteria in it, and i am coming off of antibiotics, so some probiotics are in order.
                    other than that, i have been working on this website. i am very proud of it but still have a few steps to go . . . i know that i will make it !! after it is finished,
                    i will have more time to work on art and games. i am really, really, really excited to make more games . . . i have not really had many ideas, but i know that once i
                    take the time to think . . . i will know what to do ♡ <br /> <br />

                    i know that i have had a dress-up game in the works, and i intend on finishing it. life has simply been . . . ever-changing. i have moved, i am more active
                    i am more aware of things around me, and i am more free. i am learning everyday. yesterday i did laundry for the first time in a very long time . . . and it feels good
                    to be able to do that for myself. i honestly cannot wait to do it again. i enjoy doing chores even though sometimes i lack the motivation . . . i have found a new rhythm to life,
                    and things are turning up !! ♡
